The Monal apps has a core focus: User-friendly chat experience within the XMPP network but at the same time offering the best privacy and data minimalistic and secure approach as possible. To ensure this the maintainers set a standard to their code, security measures and software architecture. But of course, the app covers the following common chat features:

  * Decentral and federated chat standard [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/)
  * Private and group messaging
  * Privacy-respecting push notifications
  * Encrypted private and group chats (state of the art encryption (OMEMO))
  * Message history
  * Free selection of your XMPP account provider
  * Voice messaging
  * Message archiving
  * Upload of files, videos and images (HTTP Upload)
  * Many settings and a design to offer privacy settings in the app to the need of the user
  * A detailed and technical listing of your supported features (so called XMPP Extensions) can be found in our [DOAP file](https://github.com/monal-im/Monal/blob/develop/monal.doap).

Planned features:

  *   Audio and Video calls

Monal is a XMPP instant messaging client for MacOS and iOS which strives to be the go-to client for these platforms just like the app Conversations IM is for Android. XMPP in general is an open and standardized protocol for real time communication. Anyone can host their own server and communicate freely with each other, just like with email and just like email the used addresses are of the form "user@domain.tld". The user can use different apps and services, such as Monal, from a single but also multiple accounts. This serves a decentral and sovereign infrastructure and digital communication on the internet but also offers many potential for innovation. Developing such a "go-to client" for iOS and MacOS involves implementing various XEP standards (XMPP extension protocols, adding modern functionality to the XMPP-core and XMPP-im RFCs, see [XMPP Extensions](https://xmpp.org/extensions/)). 

The overall outcome of Monal will be an open source and privacy friendly instant messaging client providing people the ability to use such an application instead of closed instant messaging clients by big tech companies like Facebook or Google. A good client within the Apple technology environment also serves the whole network of XMPP.
