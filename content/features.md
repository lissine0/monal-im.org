The Monal apps has a core focus: User-friendly chat experience within the XMPP network but at the same time offering the best privacy and data minimalistic and secure approach as possible. To ensure this the maintainers set a standard to their code, security measures and software architecture. But of course, the app covers the following common chat features:

  * Decentral and federated chat standard [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/)
  * Private and group messaging
  * Privacy-respecting push notifications
  * Encrypted private and group chats (state of the art encryption ([OMEMO](https://conversations.im/omemo/)))
  * Message history
  * Free selection of your XMPP account provider
  * Voice messaging
  * Message archiving
  * Upload of files, videos and images (HTTP Upload)
  * Many settings and a design to offer privacy settings in the app to the need of the user
  * A detailed and technical listing of your supported features (so called XMPP Extensions) can be found in our [DOAP file](https://github.com/monal-im/Monal/blob/develop/monal.doap).

Planned features:

  *   Audio and Video calls
