There has never been a better time to get into [XMPP](https://monal.im/welcome-to-xmpp/).
Monal is fast friendly and free. Just download the app for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monal-free-xmpp-chat/id317711500?mt=8) or [Mac](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1499227291?mt=12), login or register and you are ready to chat in minutes.
It looks and works the way other apps do, so there is no need to “learn XMPP” or even care what it is. If you have used Messenger, WhatsApp or iMessage you can use this.

It is updated to add new technology as soon as it is announced. Landscape, Portrait, split view, side by side, push notifications, dark mode, Airdrop the list goes on and keeps growing.

You are not the product
-----------------------

Monal is free and ad free but you are not the product. This app exists because we want it to and it is free because chat networks are only as good as the number of people who use it.

Technical details
-----------------

If you have made it this far, you probably want to know what makes this app tick. Monal is free and open source with a BSD license.
[Find us on GitHub!](https://github.com/monal-im/Monal)
You can also find a list of [supported XEPs]({{< relref "supportedXeps.md" >}}).
