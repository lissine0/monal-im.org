Info: Monal will stop support for iOS 12, iOS 13 and macOS Catalina!
We are searching for a SwiftUI developer.
We need a new simplified website.
With better continuous funding, our push servers will move from the US to Europe.
We have a new support mail: info@monal-im.org
Two years ago we decided to rewrite the Monal app almost entirely and improve it gradually in the process, instead of creating another XMPP Client for iOS and macOS.</description></item><item><title>Monal IM - project moved</title><link>https://monal-im.github.io/monal-im.org/post/00002-project-moved/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://monal-im.github.io/monal-im.org/post/00002-project-moved/</guid><description>We recently started to migrate the App from Anu Pokharel‘s Apple account to Thilo Molitor‘s Apple account.
As part of this transition we also deployed some new push servers to not let an old retired developer pay for the infrastructure needed for Monal.
Coming along with this transition from the old developer team to the new one is our new clean website at https://monal-im.org/. From now on, the old blog at https://monal.</description></item></channel></rss>
